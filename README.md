During the lab I modified the client.js and server.js files to create an api and a client that made calls to the api.  The api had only one endpoint that accepts a post request conting a body the with variable data.  Data is a string and the server then calculates the frequency of words with a certain number of letters up to ten letters long.  This is done by looping through the string and every incrementing up a counter until a " " is encountered.  Then the counter is reset and if the word fell between 1 an 10 letters long the corresponding word frequnecy counter was increased.  after the whole sentence is checked an array of data is sent back to the client where the client then displays the recieved data in a table that shows the frequency those words lengths were encountered.  The original client and server files required some significant modifications for this to work.
